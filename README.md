Hello there!

This was my internship project and it was about making a web application using HTML5, CSS, JS, C# and SQL for the DB.

Let's get right into it.

There are two main folders: MITCS SITE and MITCS SERVICE. 

In the first one following this path "MITCS SITE\MITCS\MITCSSite\Website" you'll find four folders. "AdminLTE-3.2.0" contains all the templates (CSS, bootstrap, etc). "JavaScript" contains all the logic process to communicate between the user's interface and the web methods through JSON files. "Page" contains all the HTML5 files. The las one contains logo images.

The second folder following this path "MITCS SERVICE\MITCSService\MITCSService\Metodos" you'll find all the web method to communicate with the DB and the JS.
