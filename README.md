Hello there!

This was my internship project and it was about making a web application using HTML5, CSS, JS, C# and SQL for the DB.

Let's get right into it.

I used "AdminLTE-3.2.0", it contains all the templates (html, SCSS, CSS, bootstrap, etc) to build the Front-End.

JavaScript contains all the logic process to communicate between the user's interface and the web methods through JSON files.

Page contains all the HTML5 files.

In "Metodos" you'll find all the web method to communicate with the DB and the JS.
